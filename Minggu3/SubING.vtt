<v Roger Bingham>The sages think themselves to be all-knowing

1
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.210
<v Roger Bingham>But we alone are wise to the virtue in those acts of folly

2
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.600
<v Roger Bingham>In this war, not even a single pawn may be spared...

3
00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Roger Bingham>Because on this chessboard, "checkmate" is not where the game ends

4
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.600
<v Roger Bingham>We are gathered here today to remember our dear comrade

5
00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Roger Bingham>In honor of her sacrifice, all work should halt for half a day as the nation mourns her passing

6
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Roger Bingham>Hehe, merely half a day...

7
00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Roger Bingham>People say the Northland Bank's true currencies are blood and tears...

8
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.250
<v Roger Bingham>But Mayor, even speaking as a banker, that sounds a little unconscionable

9
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Roger Bingham>Rosalyne died in a foreign land...

10
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.500
<v Roger Bingham>But you heartless businessmen and dignitaries

11
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.500
<v Roger Bingham>Always with a convenient excuse to remain in the comfort of your homeland...

12
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.550
<v Roger Bingham>You couldn't hope to understand

13
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.600
<v Roger Bingham>So why don't you keep your mouths shut!

14
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Roger Bingham>We don't want to make the children cry...

15
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.600
<v Roger Bingham>Hey, c'mon now, even I don't think this is the right time or place for a fight

16
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Roger Bingham>Utterly risible!

17
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.580
<v Roger Bingham>Though her methods tarnished her honor, Lohefalter's sacrifice is a great pity

18
00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Roger Bingham>Her loss shall not hinder our progress. But Dottore...

19
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Roger Bingham>What of Scaramouche and the Gnosis from Inazuma?

20
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Roger Bingham>Conventional wisdom holds that Divine Knowledge cannot be rationally comprehended

21
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.200
<v Roger Bingham>After conquering the Divine Gaze, he will make his next move

22
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:29.600
<v Roger Bingham>It's time to end tonight's foolish theatrics. Right now, you have no captive audience

23
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:39.500
<v Roger Bingham>Let every worthy sacrifice be carved in ice, and with this nation endure for all time

24
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Roger Bingham>In the name of Her Majesty, the Tsaritsa, we will seize authority from the gods...

25
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.600
<v Roger Bingham>Absolute peace

26
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Roger Bingham>Such is the gift from the Tsaritsa, such is Her Majesty's benevolence

27
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Roger Bingham>Now you rest in this coffin, encased in layer upon layer of ice

28
00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Roger Bingham>But, Rosalyne, I promise you...

29
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.200
<v Roger Bingham>Your final resting place will be the entirety of the "Old World"...

30
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.200
<v Roger Bingham>I must say, you're looking very young today, Doctor

31
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Roger Bingham>You know very well that I do not take that as a compliment

32
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Roger Bingham>So, where's the Segment in the prime of his life, then?

33
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.600
<v Roger Bingham>Heh, he's busy with... a little experiment in "blasphemy"

34
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.600
<v Roger Bingham>Collei, time to head out on patrol

35
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.600
<v Roger Bingham>Ah, okay, Master Tighnari!

36
00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.500 s
<v Roger Bingham>What was that...
